# Immunization Tracker Project   üè•

## I. Project Overview   

This project is an Immunization Tracker developed using Java and SQL, designed to manage patient immunization records. The system allows users to store and retrieve vaccination data for different patient types (children, teens, adults). It aims to provide an intuitive interface to monitor vaccination statuses, ensuring that patients are up-to-date with required vaccinations based on age groups. The tracker also includes features for tracking the **next vaccination date** and the **remaining doses** of each vaccine.

**Features:** üíâüíâ
- Tracks vaccination records of children, teens, and adults.
- Allows users to select vaccines from a predefined list.
- Provides integration with SQL for persistent data storage.
- Calculates and records the next vaccination date based on schedules (e.g., 6 months, 1 year).
- Tracks remaining doses and marks patients as fully vaccinated when all doses are completed.

## II. Data Storage and SQL Integration üìÇ

The Immunization Tracker uses an SQL database to store and manage patient and vaccination data. This ensures data persistence and allows for easy retrieval and updates.

### SQL Schema Overview:

#### Tables:
1. **Patients**
   - `patient_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `contact details`
   - `age` 
   - `additional_info` (e.g., Parent's name for children, School name for teens, Occupation for adults)

2. **Vaccines**
   - `vaccine_id` (Primary Key)
   - `vaccine_name`
   - `schedule_interval` (e.g., 6 months, 1 year)
   - `total_doses`
   - `dose_volume`

3. **VaccinationRecords**
   - `record_id` (Primary Key)
   - `patient_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `next_vaccination_date`
   - `remaining_doses`
   - `status` (Completed, Not Completed)

## III. SDG Integration ‚öïÔ∏è ü©∫

This project supports **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**. By ensuring that individuals, especially children and teens, receive necessary vaccinations, the immunization tracker plays a crucial role in promoting health and preventing disease outbreaks. The tracker helps in timely vaccination, thereby contributing to a healthier and safer community.
